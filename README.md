# StarHacks-Project
This contains the code for my Star Hacks hackathon project. My group and I created an app to help with mental health well-being. This topic was chosen because it was one of the themes for the hackathon and one of the sponsors of the hackathon had a very similar purpose to our app. Our app was presented in a way to possibly expand the sponsor's reach, and give them an app to sell to users. We had 7 hours to work on the project, and we got as much done as we could.

The technology we used to create out was Flutter, Dart, Android Studios, and an Android Emulator.

My group came second in our pool of projects, winning $50 as the prize money.

I worked on this project with three others: Alex Osterdude, Sushanth, and Aryan.
